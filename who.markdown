> Hey there! I'm Niels Delestinne and I'm a Belgian software developer by both trade and passion. 

## Who am I?
![Niels Delestinne](/assets/niels.jpg)
I was bitten by the programming bug at the age of 12, creating dynamic websites in XHTML, CSS & PHP. Not much later, 
I was creating animations & interactive websites with Macromedia Flash. 
By the age of 18, I started my studies in informatics and opened my online web bureau [Minia](http://minia.be) for 
business (every student needs to generate a bit of pocket money, right?).
In 2015 I graduated from [KUL](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) with a MSc in Applied Informatics.

My professional career took a head start at [Cegeka](https://cegeka.com), where I've been growing from a software 
engineer into an application architect. Some years later, together with an amazing colleague, we were given the chance to found and 
grow [Switchfully](https://switchfully.com): an internal venture in which we set out to find extraordinary individuals, 
train them into software developers during an intensive programming bootcamp and integrate them into our client's software teams.
Although loving to train these passionate individuals, I decided to switch (fully) back to what I love most: programming. 
To this day, I am still a proud employee of Cegeka and currently working on the creation of an advanced payroll engine for one of our customers.

## Technical background 
   
Professionally, I currently program in Java (11+) and make use of its entire ecosystem for writing the back end. 
Whenever there's the need for a front end, I tend to the Angular framework in combination with TypeScript.
More specifically, we're talking about:
- Spring Framework, Spring Boot (and other Spring projects)
- Libraries and specifications such as Jackson & JPA
- Build tools such as Maven & Gradle
- Testing frameworks like Cucumber & JUnit
- Platforms such as OpenShift, Nexus & SonarQube 
- Integration tools like Jenkins and Liquibase 
- The Angular framework
- Angular CLI
- JavaScript package managers such as NPM and Yarn
- Webpack as module bundler
- Coffee without milk

> I'm a true believer of software craftsmanship and the eXtreme Programming practices. I always strive to write readable, flexible and simple code that is properly tested. 
> I Aim to create maintainable and flexible applications in team & embrace continuous learning. 

When I'm programming in my free time, I like to dabble with different languages, frameworks & technologies which I apply on pet projects that almost never see light of day... 
But, as long as I have fun doing so, I'm doing it right.
 
From time to time, I will write and publish an article on a technical topic. Hopefully you will find and read something useful on here!

Cya, Niels
